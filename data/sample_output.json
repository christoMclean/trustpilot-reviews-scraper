    "reviewBody": "The technology has a ton of potential but the onboarding and support is so bad it isn't worth anyone's time especially a small business that doesn't have hours to wait. Missing some basic permissions and visibility settings that are considered basic CRM functionality. Was excited to use this but now need to fight to get a refund as its been a complete waste of time.",
